# Readme

üëªWe present ```GHOST```, a model that enhances stock prediction by integrating GDELT sentiment through hierarchical gating, achieving linear complexity with Mamba-based sequence modeling, and employing stock-wise tokenization to efficiently capture inter-stock correlations while reducing computational demands, as validated on real-world stock datasets.

Empirical evaluations on CSI300 and NASDAQ datasets show that the framework achieves superior performance in directional classification and risk-adjusted returns compared to existing models, providing reliable support for quantitative investment decisions.

## Usage
i.   First, configure the environment according to the requirement.txt file

Ensure that the following libraries have aligned versions:

- causal-conv1d==1.1.0
- mamba-ssm==1.1.1
- torch==2.1.1+cu118
- torchvision==0.16.1+cu118
- torchaudio==0.16.1+cu118

ii. Download stock data to ```.\dataset\stock_data```  

market sentiment data to ```.\dataset```

iii. Finally, ```python run.py``` .

üí°üí°üí° Don't forget to modify the number of input stocks and the number of features.Considering that ```mamba-ssm``` depends on a Linux environment, we used ```Ubuntu 22.04``` with ```miniconda``` as the basic environment. I have also placed the wheels of these two libraries in the corresponding links, hoping this will make the reproduction of this work more convenient and quick.

## Dataset


We provide stock data from two markets: ```CSI300``` and ```NASDAQ100```. After data preprocessing, 189 and 64 stocks remain respectively, along with corresponding market sentiment data: ```CHN_NEWS_sentiment.csv``` and ```USA_NEWS_sentiment.csv```.

The market sentiment information of China and the United States is time-step aligned with the stock data of CSI300 and NASDAQ100 respectively. You can choose any connection to download the data.

At the same time, you need to modify ```sentiment_path="your root"``` in ```.\data_provider\data_loader``` to adapt to the file path of sentiment data.Also, note that there are some differences in the feature engineering of NASDAQ100 and CSI300 stock data, so you need to modify the ```feature_columns``` in ```.\data_provider\data_loader```accordingly.

üöÄFinally, the complete code for market sentiment data will also be open-sourced in the future.
